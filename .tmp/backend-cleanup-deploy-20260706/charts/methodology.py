"""Canonical Ngoma Charts scoring and platform methodology.

There are deliberately two point systems:

* weekly/raw points (Top 100): ``101 - rank``; these build monthly rankings;
* public points (Top 50): ``51 - rank``; these power every public aggregate.

Platform database settings are descriptive metadata. They must never change
either formula.
